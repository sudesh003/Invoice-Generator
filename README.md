# Invoice-Generator
The invoice generator is a web application that allows users to create invoices. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main interface of the application consists of a form that prompts the user to enter information about the invoice, such as the customer's name and address, the items or services being billed, and the total amount due. The form is designed using HTML and styled using CSS to ensure a clean and professional appearance.

Once the user has entered the necessary information, they can click a button to generate the invoice. This action triggers a JavaScript function that processes the user input and creates a dynamic invoice document.

The resulting invoice document saved as a PDF, allowing the user to easily send it to their clients or record it for their own records.

Overall, the invoice generator provides a simple and efficient way for businesses to create and manage their invoices, while leveraging the power of modern web technologies to create a seamless user experience.
